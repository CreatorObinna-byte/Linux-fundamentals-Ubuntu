Here i used the permission values 700 and 400 respectively for the home1 directory, 

were 700 means; 
"The owner of the directory can Read Write and Execute" and
"Others can neither Read Write nor Execute"

While 400 means;
"The owner of the directory can only Read" and
"Others can neither Read Write nor Execute"

Above i tested the remote connectivity using yahoo.com.

The output of the ping command displays the result of each echo request, including the round trip time, and providing a summary of the overall results.

Ping command is a valuable tool for network troubleshooting and diagnostics which is available on virtually any operating system with network connectivity.
